# challenge-4

## description

In this challenge we were required to build a timed coding quiz that imposed a time penalty for each correct answer. Once the time ran out or all questions were answered the participant could then enter their name to be recorded along with their score in the high score list. The participant could click on a button to display a list of all the scores.
